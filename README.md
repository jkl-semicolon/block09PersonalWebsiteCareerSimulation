My Website
     -Alex Wang

Notes to reviewer:

This website's contents are not focused. Nonetheless, the homepage features a link to my BoardGameGeek account; feel free to peruse my board game collection (note: some newer purchases are missing from the record). The 'About Me' page gives short introductions to some of my hobbies, with a short (less than 4 minute long YouTube video for each). Feel free to watch the videos! The 'Portfolio' page is not completed yet, and would've featured some of my past .html files created for this class.

Spent a decent amount of time first working on the header, and then page by page.
Unfortunately, I ran out of time and was not able to complete the 'Portfolio' page.
Focused on getting the header the way I wanted, and also spent time on spacing for the 'Homepage' and 'About Me' pages.

Is it just me, or is a lot of css formatting putting containers into more containers??

My .html and .css files are unfortunately spaghetti code it seems.. Some redundancy, and lots of random IDs sprinkled throughout. I'm sure there is also some redundant and/or conflicting CSS. Will focus on cleaning my designs up on future projects.
